    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a well-focused and highly motivated Computer Science and Engineering professional
      with over 8 years of industry experience currenly working as a senior software engineer
      at Qliro AB. I obtained the degree European Master of Distributed Computing offered by
      both institutes KTH Sweden and IST Portugal.

      I mainly grew within the financial industry (mostly within Payment Systems) as a backend 
      software engineer which is quite challenging but quite fun at the same time. I am fond 
      of working with highly available systems with large volumes. It always helps me to optimize 
      the system over time giving the opportunity to learn latest technologies and practices.
